Programming languag(JavaScript) Vm (visual machine), library, socket/HTTP
TPC/IP transport its like IP
IP -Internal protocol, is used to connect one computer to other
(HTTP)
Windows SDK socket, connecting libraries
Windows SDK driver for network card
SDK-software development kit(set of tools)
Network card (physicasl microchip)

Today we made a code, yappy. We used Ip, port, library, classes and chatgpt


Lesson 11.02
Matrix,list,array,queue,dict.
HTTP- has two parts - Client and server
Request-client    response-server
HTTP client library, server library

requesr has Methods: GET, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS,....
Status codes: 2xx -succes

4xx-client errors
5xx-server errors                                                                                                                                                                                                                      

(both have)Header and body

Request: method(POST, GET, DELETE,... ==REST), headers, body
Representational State Transfer (REST) is a software architecture that imposes conditions on how an API should work.

Url parts: http://username:password@hostname.9090/path?arg=value#anchor
http/https - protocol

How someone can attack:
XSS Cross site scripting - unsecured inputs in forms, public forms, reviews, comments, bio, username
                          <script> clean html in asp.net

SQL injection- ´SELECT * FROM products WHERE name = '%${req.query.search}%'´
                "SELECT * FROM products WHERE name = '%car'; UPDATE user SET
                password= '' WHERE role 'admin' --%'"
                search="car''; UPDATE users SET password '''' WHERE 
                role=''admin'' --"

                db.execute(
                ´SELECT * FROM products WHERE name = '%?%' AND createdat > ?´,
                [req.query.search, req.query.start]
                )

NB! Frameworks are different and working differently

Brute force, both password and directory traversing
How to protect:
Rate limiting plugin/middleware
IP based rate limiting, 1000 login requests per 1 minute

32-64 char in the link

Misconfigurations
CORS
Cookie/token
